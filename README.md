# Fruit Calorie Calculator

### Work in progress of a fruits calculator app that adds the fruits the user inputs into a list and sums up the calories of those fruits.

### To run open up terminal and navigate to the app directory, then run 'npm run dev' and use live server on index.html file to view page.

### Work to be done:
1. Complete CSS styling of the page to make it neat
2. Add more functionality in future e.g. quantity selector and other foods
3. Get better quality image API - maybe PNG icons
